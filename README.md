## 🧠 System Overview

This project implements a **smart IoT robot** using a Raspberry Pi and MQTT (Adafruit IO).  
The robot can be controlled remotely via a cloud dashboard and logs its telemetry data locally.

### ✅ Key Features
- Cloud control (Adafruit IO MQTT)
- Start / Stop motor control
- Adjustable speed (0–100%)
- Emergency stop override
- Local CSV logging & JSON event logging
- Daily file rotation
- Heartbeat status feed
- Graceful shutdown + retry logic

> ⚠️ Hardware Note: Freenove sensor board malfunctioned.  
Sensors are simulated, but all IoT logic, logging, MQTT feeds, and dashboard work fully.

## 🗄️ Data Format Specification & File Rotation Policy

This project logs robot telemetry data locally on the Raspberry Pi to ensure reliability even if the network is unavailable. Two log files are created each day: one CSV file for telemetry and one JSON lines file for important events.

### Telemetry CSV format (logged every ~2 seconds):
- timestamp (ISO-8601, UTC)
- distance sensor reading (cm) – simulated (blank due to hardware issue)
- line sensor state – simulated (blank)
- battery voltage – simulated (blank)
- running state (0 or 1)
- emergency state (0 or 1)
- speed command (% from Adafruit dashboard)
- left motor duty cycle (%)
- right motor duty cycle (%)

### Event log format (JSONL, whenever an important event happens):
- timestamp
- event name (ex: “emergency_on”)
- robot state (running or stopped)
- speed value at event moment

### File rotation policy:
- Log files are created daily
- File name format: YYYY-MM-DD_robot_telemetry.csv and YYYY-MM-DD_events.jsonl
- Files are stored locally in data/ and logs/ folders
- Old log files remain saved for history unless manually deleted
- UTC timezone used for consistent timestamps

### Purpose:
- Ensures long-term data storage
- Protects against cloud outages
- Provides evidence of robot operation history for milestone requirements

## ⚠️ Known Limitations and 🚀 Future Work

### Known Limitations
- Freenove sensor board malfunctioned, so ultrasonic, line-tracking, and camera sensors are not active.
- Robot currently runs only in manual MQTT control mode (no autonomous movement).
- Motor feedback uses PWM percentage — no wheel encoders for real speed measurement.

### Future Work
- Replace sensor hardware and reactivate distance, line-tracking, and camera modules.
- Implement autonomous modes (line following, obstacle avoidance, room mapping).
- Add video streaming with OpenCV / Pi Camera for remote monitoring.
- Add battery voltage monitoring and low-battery safe shutdown.
- Build a local Flask or FastAPI web dashboard for offline control.
