## 🧠 System Overview

This project implements a **smart IoT robot** using a Raspberry Pi and MQTT (Adafruit IO).  
The robot can be controlled remotely via a cloud dashboard and logs its telemetry data locally.

### ✅ Key Features
- Cloud control (Adafruit IO MQTT)
- Start / Stop motor control
- Adjustable speed (0–100%)
- Emergency stop override
- Local CSV logging & JSON event logging
- Daily file rotation
- Heartbeat status feed
- Graceful shutdown + retry logic

> ⚠️ Hardware Note: Freenove sensor board malfunctioned.  
Sensors are simulated, but all IoT logic, logging, MQTT feeds, and dashboard work fully.

## 🗄️ Data Format Specification & File Rotation Policy

This project logs robot telemetry data locally on the Raspberry Pi to ensure reliability even if the network is unavailable. Two log files are created each day: one CSV file for telemetry and one JSON lines file for important events.
### Telemetry CSV format (logged every ~2 seconds):
