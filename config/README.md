# Configuration Files

This folder stores configuration files for the robot system.

Included:
- config.json (MQTT feed names, motion parameters, etc.)

Ensure sensitive keys remain in `.env` and are NOT committed to this folder.

Update config.json if feed names, speed parameters, or robot behavior settings change.
